      <h1><a name='cheap'>Cheap Restaurants <span>(0-50dhm)</span></a></h1>
      
      <div class='entry'><h2>1. Cafeteria Al Liwan</h2><p>This is one of the few restaurants in Abu Dhabi to offer a variety of typical Damascene dishes, including pastries like manakeesh, fried kibah and safiha. You should definitely try their falafel or selection of hummus. Dishes are quite generous, and the price is in the mid-low range. The place has a small, cozy atmosphere and its interior walls are full of scribbled messages left by its costumers over the years.</p><p><span>Address: </span>A bit hard to spot: on the side of the block opposite to al-Mazrouie hospital on Fatima Bint Al Mubarak Street.</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 622 1255</p></div>
      
      <div class='entry'><h2>2. Bait El-Khetyar</h2><p>Amazing Lebanese restaurant with mouth-watering, right-off-the-oven bread and a variety of saj, meat dishes and other Arabic mezze for quite cheap, especially if you’re in a group. I’ve seen picky Lebanese friends devour their mousakhan with no grace. Would definitely give it a try if you’re a Maroosh staunch — you might change your allegiance.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Close to the crossing with Zayed the First St on Fatima Bint al Mubarak Street.</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 633 3200</p></div>
      
      <div class='entry'><h2>3. Russian Kitchen House Cafeteria</h2><p>Tiny little cafe serving up delicious Russian/Ukranian food. The perfect place to stuff yourself with carbs on a budget. If you're new to the cuisine try the herring salad, the vareniki (like pierogies), the ox tongue and the fresh fruit compote.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Try Google maps or Zomato to get a general idea. It's near the Russian embassy, which is near the Royal Meridien Hotel. Ask around or call them once you're in the area. </p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 674 4342</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>4. Masala</h2><p></p><p><span>Address: </span>Electra Street, go past Sama tower for 1km and it's on your left</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 633 7748</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>5. Chhappan Bhog Restaurant</h2><p>Cheap, South-Indian street food at it's finest. Incredible chaat, dosas etc. makes it a definite standout for budget eats. Try the Dahi Raj Kachoori, the Coconut Rava Masla Dosa, Channa Bhatoora and Tripti Bhog for desert. </p><p><span>Address: </span>Behind the ADCB Building on Electra St</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 677 8864</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>6. Bonna Annee Ethiopian Restaurant</h2><p>Cheap, delicious and plentiful Ethiopian food all served up on large swathes of tasy Injera bread. Relaxed atmosphere and a great social dining experience. Works for large groups.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Tourist Club Area near Gad Restaurant</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 491 2128</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>7. Taqado Mexican Kitchen</h2><p>A Friday morning classic. Honestly, it's just a Chipotle rip-off, but that's a blessing in Abu Dhabi. Burritos are the star of the show (make sure you get the barbacoa beef), but definitely try the churros cajeta (fried dough stuffed with dulce de leche). On the low, they have some of the best coffee in Abu Dhabi.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Left side, 1st floor Galleria Mall</p><p><span>Phone: </span>04 325 9660</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>8. Maroosh</h2><p>An NYUAD classic. Solid lebanese food. Don't be tempted by the mixed grills. Try the shish tawook, all the classic starters and make sure to get extra toum (garlic sauce). Some locations do excellent takeaway sandwiches and make sure to try the cocktail juice.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Near the mosque behind and across the street from DTC</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 6214424</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>9. Highway 55</h2><p>Retro diner themed American burger chain. Avoid the cheese steaks and stick to the burgers.</p><p><span>Address: </span>On Al Muroor rd near Al Mamoura Building</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 6411161</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>10. Corniche Towers Food Row</h2><p>Small street lined with cheap and tasty little restaurants. A big teen hangout spot, so it's cool place to get a look at local culture. Try burgers at Fly Hot Dog, shawarma at Shish Shawerma (arguably the best in the city) and wings at Buffalo Wings &amp; Rings</p><p><span>Address: </span>Behind Corniche Towers Apartments</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 633 7748</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>11. China Friends</h2><p>This place might actually make you feel like you’re in some mid-range restaurant in some legit Chinatown, with its bright red decorations, and the buzz of China’s CCTV news channel on the side (and, if you’re lucky, some karaoke on the background). The restaurant offers authentic dishes like black fungus, jellyfish, boiled chicken, and grilled meats of all sorts, though the prices are a bit salty and can vary around 55AED per person. And of course, you also have the option to reserve the karaoke if you fancy so. The place is really easy to miss. It is on the second floor in the the inside of the block, but you can quickly spot the red sign and lanterns on atop the entrance.</p><p><span>Address: </span>It's complicated. Look it up on Google and don't be afraid to call the place when you're nearby.</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 628 9586</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>12. Hankook Korean Restaurant</h2><p>The Abu Dhabi favorite for Korean BBQ. If you call in advance you can get a private room for the true big group experience. They also do good stone bowl classics like bibimbap, bulgogi etc.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Opposite the bus station near al Wahda mall, look it up because it's a little hard to find.</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 642 3399</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>13. Pizza di Rocco</h2><p>Surprisingly good pizza for Abu Dhabi. Smaller pies, with nice ingredients, cooked in a proper oven. All their combinations are pretty good, so pick whatever look interesting, but consider saving space for a Nutella dessert pizza. </p><p><span>Address: </span>Google</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 641 8300</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>14. Jones the Grocer (Al Nahyan &amp; near Oryx Hotel)</h2><p>Mid range restaurant serving typical American/European food. The burger is a favorite and one location has a cheese room. The best park is that you can get a drink with your meal.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Pearl Plaza Tower next to the Oryx Hotel &amp; Al Mamoura Building B, Corner 4th Muroor &amp; 15th Street</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 639 5883 &amp; 02 4438 762</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>15. Leopold's of London (Reem &amp; Galleria)</h2><p>Mid range restaurant serving typical American/European food (salads, pastas, burger, pizza).

      <div class='entry'><h2>16. Shake Shack</h2><p>Fast-growing American chain that specializes in fantastic burgers and wonderful ice cream treats (try a "concrete").

      <div class='entry'><h2>17. Dai Pai Dong</h2><p>Mid price range restaurant specializing in Chinese street food (if you miss your semester in Shanghai, this is gonna be the best you'll get). Hand pulled noodles and barbecued meats are great. Speakeasy style place for drinks attached.  </p><p><span>Address: </span>Left side of the bottom floor of the Galleria Mall on Al Maryah Island. Can also enter from the Rosewood Hotel.</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 813 5552</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>18. Hanoi Naturally</h2><p>Surprisingly "authentic" Vietnamese restaurant on Reem Island. Everything's pretty good, but if you don't know what to order, try the noodle soups or the crispy fried duck/fish.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Reem Boutik Mall</p><p><span>Phone: </span>04 4313099</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>19. Inner Mongolian Hot Pot</h2><p>Inner Mongolia is a really social dining experience and it's perfect for large groups.

Make sure to grab some of the delightful black fungus mushroom. </p><p><span>Address: </span>Beside Phoenix Plaza Hotel Apartments, Near Al Wahda Mall</p><p><span>Phone: </span>05 01517228</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>20. Nandos (WTC)</h2><p>South-African-born chain of British fame that serves portugese roast chicken marinated in their special Peri Peri sauce. Grab a group of friends, get a chicken and some fries and then eat until you can't move. </p><p><span>Address: </span>Top Floor World Trade Center Mall</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 6310002</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>21. Cafe Arabia</h2><p>Weekend Brunch with friends or visiting parents, this place is clean and contemporary. Both Western and Arabian style brunches available. Kind of feels like NYC brunch but without the wait in line.</p><p><span>Address: </span>Villa No. 37, 15th Street, Airport Rd - Opposite Al Mushrif Children’s Park</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 6439699</p></div>

      <div class='entry'><h2>22. Cho Gao</h2><p>An NYUAD classic. Chilled out bar and lounge makes this a great place to grab a drink with a friend. There is Asian-fusion food available but it's cheaper to eat elsewhere. Really it's the tasty cocktails and the chance to tuck away at a table and catch up with friends that makes it worth going. Drinks are roughly 35-50aed. It's smoke-free too!</p><p><span>Address: </span>Crowne Plaza Hotel, Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Street</p><p><span>Phone: </span>02 6166149</p></div>
